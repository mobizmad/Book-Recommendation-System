# Hybrid Book Recommendation System  

## Overview  
This project implements a **Hybrid Book Recommendation System** by combining multiple approaches to improve accuracy and user satisfaction.  

1️⃣ **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** – A collaborative filtering technique that predicts ratings based on user-book interactions.  
2️⃣ **Top-N Popular Books** – Recommends books based on the highest rating count and average rating.  
3️⃣ **Hybrid Approach** – Merges SVD-based personalized recommendations with popular books to balance accuracy and diversity.

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
🔹 **Surprise Library** – Provides SVD implementation, dataset handling, train-test split, and RMSE calculation.  
🔹 **Pandas** – Used for data processing and manipulation.  
🔹 **Python** – The primary programming language for implementation.

## 📌 Implementation Steps  

✅ **Data Preprocessing**  
- Load book rating and metadata datasets.  
- Handle missing values and preprocess data for analysis.  

✅ **Collaborative Filtering with SVD**  
- Train an SVD model using user-book interactions.  
- Predict user ratings for books they haven't rated yet.  

✅ **Top-N Popular Books**  
- Rank books based on rating count and average rating.  
- Generate a list of most popular books.  

✅ **Hybrid Recommendation System**  
- Combine SVD predictions with popular book recommendations.  
- Fine-tune recommendations for improved personalization and relevance.  

✅ **Evaluation**  
- Measure model performance using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.  
- Compare accuracy and effectiveness of individual and hybrid approaches.
